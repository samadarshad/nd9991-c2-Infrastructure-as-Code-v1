  # instace profile contains the IAM Role name(s) that we want to associate to our auto scaling EC2 Servers
  # never give too much permissions to your EC2 instances! if they get hacked, the permissions get hacked also!
  # in this example, I create a Role called UdacityS3ReadOnlyC2 and just give it a policy of S3 Read-Only Access
  # ProfileWithRolesForOurApp:
  #   Type: AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile
  #   Properties: 
  #     Roles:
  #       - UdacityS3ReadOnlyEC2

  # This is also optional.
  # Bonus points for useful outputs!
  # for example, if you create a Load Balancer
  # it's nice to output the URL to it here, so that we don't have to go to the console to get it.

# Sample UserData
# When creating your Launch Configuration, you may need a UserData script
# here's one that you can use for Ubuntu Linux that will:
# Install Apache Web Server, Start it, and create an index.html that will be displayed
# when you visit the IP address of this server with your web browser
#Here it is:
#
#          #!/bin/bash
#          apt-get update -y
#          apt-get install apache2 -y
#          systemctl start apache2.service
#          cd /var/www/html
#          echo "Udacity Demo Web Server Up and Running!" > index.html
